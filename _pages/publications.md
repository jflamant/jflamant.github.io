I also maintain a full, up-to-date publication list on <a href ="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rNN19hcAAAAJ"> Google Scholar</a>. and on <a href="https://cv.hal.science/julien-flamant" >HAL</a>. For most papers, a PDF version of the author accepted manuscript can be found by clicking either on HAL (French open-access scientific library) or ArXiv. If you don't find one of the publications below, feel free to reach me <a href="mailto:julien.flamant@cnrs.fr" >by email</a>.
