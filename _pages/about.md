Welcome !

I am a CNRS research scientist in Nancy, France. Im a member of the [SiMul research group](https://cran-simul.github.io), the multidimensional signal processing research group in the [BioSiS](http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/francais/themes_rech/biosis/index.php) department at [CRAN](http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/).
<br/>
<br/>
I develop **signal processing theory and methods** to leverage **polarization** properties in physics, focusing on interpretable, geometric and algebraic approaches.
<br/>
My research interests include phase retrieval, bivariate signal processing, polarimetric imaging, quaternion-valued signal processing, with applications to physical sciences.

<br/>
<br/>

<!-- <br/> Wanna join our group? We have currently a 12-month postdoctoral researcher position available on [Geometric Bayesian inference for bivariate signals](/assets/jobs/2023postDocRicochetCRAN.pdf), starting anytime in 2023. See also this [master internship](/assets/jobs/2023_internshipMaster.pdf) position. -->

## open positions
<!-- Multiple positions (master, Ph.D. and postdoc) are opened right now, in relation with the research projects above.
Interested? contact me directly by [email](mailto:julien.flamant@cnrs.fr), joining a CV and a brief statement of interest.
 -->
Several positions are currently open for Spring 26 (*check out instructions in pdfs on how to apply*)
- 6 months M2 internship in Nancy, [Acoustics and Signal Processing](/assets/jobs/2026_M2_stage_CRAN_SCRIPPS.pdf), with [Julien Bonnel](https://sioa.ucsd.edu//) (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD), starting Feb. 2026.



## ongoing research projects
<!-- **News** I have recently been awarded a ANR Young researcher Grant ATEMPORAL, with funding for a master internship followed by a Ph.D., plus a 18 month postdoc, as well as extensive research support for travel. -->
I am currently involved in the following research projects
- [**ANR JCJC ATEMPORAL, 2024-2027**](/atemporal): Algebraic and Tensor Methods for Polarimetric Phase Retrieval (PI)
- [**ANR PRC RICOCHET, 2022-2026**](https://ricochet-anr.github.io): Bivariate signal processing:
a geometric approach to decipher polarization (Leader for CRAN)

## supervision
Currently, I am involved in the supervision of
- [Djahine Bourahla](), Ph.D. student since Nov. 2025, co-supervised with Marc Allain and David Brie.
- [Antonio Fazzi](https://fazziant.github.io/): Postdoctoral fellow, since Nov. 2024, co-supervised with Konstantin Usevich.


*Alumni*
- [Saulo Cardoso Barreto](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=S5pUT9UAAAAJ&hl=fr): Ph.D. student (2022-2025) co-supervised with Sebastian Miron.
