Welcome !

I am a CNRS research scientist in Nancy, France. Im a member of the [SiMul research group](https://cran-simul.github.io), the multidimensional signal processing research group in the [BioSiS](http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/francais/themes_rech/biosis/index.php) department at [CRAN](http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/).
<br/>
<br/>
I develop **signal processing theory and methods** to leverage **polarization** properties in physics, focusing on interpretable, geometric and algebraic approaches.
<br/>
My research interests include phase retrieval, bivariate signal processing, polarimetric imaging, quaternion-valued signal processing, with applications to physical sciences.

<br/>
<br/>

<!-- <br/> Wanna join our group? We have currently a 12-month postdoctoral researcher position available on [Geometric Bayesian inference for bivariate signals](/assets/jobs/2023postDocRicochetCRAN.pdf), starting anytime in 2023. See also this [master internship](/assets/jobs/2023_internshipMaster.pdf) position. -->

## open positions
<!-- Multiple positions (master, Ph.D. and postdoc) are opened right now, in relation with the research projects above.
Interested? contact me directly by [email](mailto:julien.flamant@cnrs.fr), joining a CV and a brief statement of interest.
 -->
Several positions are currently open for Spring 25 (*check out instructions in pdfs on how to apply*)
- 6 months M2 internship in Nancy, [Acoustics and Signal Processing](/assets/jobs/2025_M2_acoustics_CRAN_WHOI.pdf), with [Julien Bonnel](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/jbonnel/) (WHOI)
- 6 months M2 internship in Grenoble, [Geometric phase of multivariate signals](/assets/jobs/2025_M2_geometricphase.pdf) with [Nicolas Le Bihan](https://nicolas-le-bihan.github.io/) and [Pierre-Olivier Amblard](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~pierre-olivier.amblard/). <span style="color:red">[fulfilled] </span>


## ongoing research projects
<!-- **News** I have recently been awarded a ANR Young researcher Grant ATEMPORAL, with funding for a master internship followed by a Ph.D., plus a 18 month postdoc, as well as extensive research support for travel. -->
I am currently involved in the following research projects
- [**ANR JCJC ATEMPORAL, 2024-2027**](/atemporal): Algebraic and Tensor Methods for Polarimetric Phase Retrieval (PI)
- [**ANR PRC RICOCHET, 2022-2026**](https://ricochet-anr.github.io): Bivariate signal processing:
a geometric approach to decipher polarization (Leader for CRAN)

## supervision
Currently, I am involved in the supervision of
- [Saulo Cardoso Barreto](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=S5pUT9UAAAAJ&hl=fr): Ph.D. student, since Oct. 2022, co-supervised with Sebastian Miron.
- [Antonio Fazzi](https://fazziant.github.io/): Postdoctoral fellow, since Nov. 2024, co-supervised with Konstantin Usevich.
