Welcome !

I am a CNRS research scientist at [CRAN](http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/) since 2019. I am a member of the [SiMul research group.](https://cran-simul.github.io), the multidimensional signal processing research group in the [BioSiS](http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/francais/themes_rech/biosis/index.php) department at [CRAN](http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/).
<br/>
<br/>
I develop **signal processing theory and methods** to leverage **polarization** properties in physics, focusing on interpretable, geometric and algebraic approaches. 
<br/>
My research interests include phase retrieval, bivariate signal processing, polarimetric imaging, quaternion-valued signal processing, with applications to physical sciences.  

<br/>
<br/>

<!-- <br/> Wanna join our group? We have currently a 12-month postdoctoral researcher position available on [Geometric Bayesian inference for bivariate signals](/assets/jobs/2023postDocRicochetCRAN.pdf), starting anytime in 2023. See also this [master internship](/assets/jobs/2023_internshipMaster.pdf) position. -->


## ongoing research projects
**News** I have recently been awarded a ANR Young researcher Grant ATEMPORAL, with funding for a master internship followed by a Ph.D., plus a 18 month postdoc, as well as extensive research support for travel.

- [**ANR JCJC ATEMPORAL, 2024-2027**](/atemporal): Algebraic and Tensor Methods for Polarimetric Phase Retrieval
- [**ANR PRC RICOCHET, 2022-2026**](https://ricochet-anr.github.io): Bivariate signal processing:
a geometric approach to decipher polarization

Multiple positions (master, Ph.D. and postdoc) are opened right now, in relation with the research projects above. 
Interested? contact me directly by [email](mailto:julien.flamant@cnrs.fr), joining a CV and a brief statement of interest.
