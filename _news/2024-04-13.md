Together with [Nicolas Le Bihan](https://nicolas-le-bihan.github.io/), I will be presenting a tutorial at EUSIPCO 2024 titled ["An introduction to bivariate signal processing: polarization, quaternions and geometric representations"](https://eusipcolyon.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/28).
See you all in Lyon next August!
