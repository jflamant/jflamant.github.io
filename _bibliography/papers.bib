abstract={This paper provides an introduction to an intriguing geometric phenomenon that can occur when considering narrowband bivariate signals. This so-called geometric phase may appear when the signal normalized second order instantaneous moment follows a smooth curve in the curved projective space. The resulting geometric phase is independent of the signal frequency and magnitude. Well known in quantum mechanics, optics or non-holonomic dynamical systems, the geometric phase can be computed using the concept of Bargmann invariant. It is associated to the time evolution of polarization parameters for bivariate signals. Numerical simulations on signal processing examples illustrate the pecular phenomenon of geometric phase. },

The main aim of this article is to counter this misconception and to demystify the use of quaternion algebra for solving problems in signal and image processing. To this end, we propose a comprehensive and objective overview of the key aspects of quaternion representations, models, and methods and illustrate our journey through the literature with flagship applications. We conclude this work by an outlook on the remaining challenges and open problems in quaternion signal and image processing. },

This article derives broadband properties of Ep and Ek in an oceanic waveguide, with restriction to a far-field context under which the acoustic field can be described by a set of propagating trapped modes. Using a set of reasonable assumptions, it is analytically demonstrated that, when integrated over a wide enough frequency-band, Ep = Ek everywhere in the waveguide, except at four specific depths: z = 0 (sea surface), z = D (seafloor), z = zs (source depth), and z=D−zs (mirrored source depth). Several realistic simulations are also presented to show the relevance of the analytical derivation. It is notably illustrated that, when integrated over third-octave bands, Ep≃Ek within 1 dB everywhere in the far-field waveguide, except in the first few meters of the water column (on a dB scale, no significant difference is found between Ep and Ek for z = D, z = zs, and z=D−zs). },

abstract={This paper introduces a complete approach for the recovery of polarimetric images from experimental intensity measurements. In many applications, such images collect, at each pixel, a Stokes vector encoding the polarization state of light. By representing a Stokes vector image as a third-order tensor, we propose a new physicallyconstrained block-term tensor decomposition called Stokes-BTD. The proposed model is flexible and comes with broad identifiability guarantees. Moreover, physical constraints ensure meaningful interpretation of low-rank terms as Stokes vectors. In practice, Stokes images must be recovered from indirect, intensity measurements. To this aim, we implement two recovery algorithms for Stokes-BTD based on constrained alternated optimization and highlight constraints related to Stokes vectors. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data illustrate the potential of the approach.},

  abstract={Matrix-valued imaging appears in many applications ranging from polarimetric remote sensing to medical imaging. Such images can be represented as 4th-order tensors, where the first two dimensions correspond to spatial variables and the last two encode the matrix feature in each pixel. To efficiently analyze, decompose, and process these images, this paper introduces the block-block terms decomposition (BBTD), a novel low-rank tensor decomposition model that extends bilinear matrix factorization to 4th-order tensors. Low-rank assumptions permit to greatly reduce the number of parameters to be estimated and enable the enforcement of key physical constraints on matrix sources. We establish both a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for uniqueness of the BBTD model. To enable the use of BBTD in covariance matrix-valued imaging, we develop an AO-ADMM framework that allows efficient handling of non-negativity and symmetry constraints on the decomposition factors. This leads to a fast and computationally efficient algorithm. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data from DTI illustrate the potential of the BBTD model in matrix-valued imaging.},

To do this, a damped ellipse is seen as a specific quaternion-valued signal for which dynamical parameters (damping and frequency) are separated from the geometrical/polarization parameters which are here considered constant in time. To obtain the parameters of this model, SONATA relies on alternated optimization. While updating the geometrical parameters is done in the quaternion-domain, the update of dynamical parameters is performed via complex structured low-rank approximations. Finally, a gravitational wave data analysis is demonstrated: an example for which the low-rank model of SONATA is adequate.},

  abstract={In many applications and physical phenomena, bivariate signals are polarized, i.e. they trace an elliptical trajectory over time when viewed in the 2D planes of their two components. The smooth evolution of this elliptical trajectory, called polarization ellipse, is highly informative to solve ill-posed inverse problems involving bivariate signals where the signal is collected through indirect, noisy or incomplete measurements. This work proposes a novel formulation and an efficient algorithm for reconstructing bivariate signals with polarization regularization. The proposed formulation leverages the compact representation of polarization through the instantaneous covariance matrices. To address the resulting quartic optimization problem, we propose a well-suited parameter splitting strategy which leads to an efficient iterative algorithm (alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)) with convex subproblems at each iteration. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated on numerical synthetic data experiments. },

We provide a complete characterization of its uniqueness properties by unraveling equivalencies with two related problems, namely bivariate phase retrieval and a polynomial autocorrelation factorization problem. In particular, we show that the problem admits a unique solution, which can be formulated as a greatest common divisor (GCD) of measurements polynomials. As a result, we propose algebraic solutions for PPR based on approximate GCD computations using the null-space properties Sylvester matrices. Alternatively, existing iterative algorithms for phase retrieval, semidefinite positive relaxation and Wirtinger-Flow, are carefully adapted to solve the PPR problem. Finally, a set of numerical experiments permits a detailed assessment of the numerical behavior and relative performances of each proposed reconstruction strategy. They further demonstrate the fruitful combination of algebraic and iterative approaches towards a scalable, computationally efficient and robust to noise reconstruction strategy for PPR.},

  abstract={Multidimensional quaternion arrays (often referred to as "quaternion tensors") and their decompositions have recently gained increasing attention in various fields such as color and polarimetric imaging or video processing. Despite this growing interest, the theoretical development of quaternion tensors remains limited. This paper introduces a novel multilinear framework for quaternion arrays, which extends the classical tensor analysis to multidimensional quaternion data in a rigorous manner. Specifically, we propose a new definition of quaternion tensors as HR-multilinear forms, addressing the challenges posed by the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Within this framework, we establish the Tucker decomposition for quaternion tensors and develop a quaternion Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (Q-CPD). We thoroughly investigate the properties of the Q-CPD, including trivial ambiguities, complex equivalent models, and sufficient conditions for uniqueness. Additionally, we present two algorithms for computing the Q-CPD and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments. Our results provide a solid theoretical foundation for further research on quaternion tensor decompositions and offer new computational tools for practitioners working with quaternion multiway data. },

Stokes parameters of acoustic normal modes are theoretically derived, and a signal processing framework to estimate them is introduced. The concept of polarization spectrogram, which enables the visualization of the Stokes parameters using data from a single vector sensor, is also introduced. The whole framework is illustrated on simulated data, as well as on experimental data collected during the 2017 Seabed Characterization Experiment (SBCEX17). By introducing the Stokes framework used in many other fields, the article opens the door to a large set of methods developed and used in other contexts, but largely ignored in ocean acoustics.},

His results are based on empirical observations on the distribution of the zeros of the spectrogram of white Gaussian noise. These zeros tend to be uniformly spread over the time-frequency plane, and not to clutter. Our contributions are threefold: we rigorously define the zeros of the spectrogram of continuous white Gaussian noise, we explicitly characterize their statistical distribution, and we investigate the computational and statistical underpinnings of the practical implementation of signal detection based on the statistics of spectrogram zeros. In particular, we stress that the zeros of spectrograms of white Gaussian noise correspond to zeros of Gaussian analytic functions, a topic of recent independent mathematical interest [Hough et al., 2009].},

abstract = {IEEE A novel approach towards the spectral analysis of stationary random bivariate signals is proposed. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed framework exhibits a natural link between well-defined statistical objects and physical parameters for bivariate signals. Using the Quaternion Fourier Transform, we introduce a quaternion-valued spectral representation of random bivariate signals seen as complex-valued sequences. This makes possible the definition of a scalar quaternion-valued spectral density and the corresponding autocovariance for bivariate signals. This spectral density can be meaningfully interpreted in terms of frequency-dependent polarization attributes. A natural decomposition of the spectral density of any random bivariate signal in terms of unpolarized and polarized components is introduced. Nonparametric spectral density estimation is investigated, and we introduce the polarization periodogram of a random bivariate signal. Numerical experiments support our theoretical analysis, illustrating the relevance of the approach on synthetic data.},

  Abstract={Many phenomena are described by bivariate signals or bidimensional vectors in applications ranging from radar to EEG, optics and oceanography. The time-frequency analysis of bivariate signals is usually carried out by analyzing two separate quantities, e.g. rotary components. We show that an adequate quaternion Fourier transform permits to build relevant time-frequency representations of bivariate signals that naturally identify geometrical or polarization properties. First, the quaternion embedding of bivariate signals is introduced, similar to the usual analytic signal of real signals. Then two fundamental theorems ensure that a quaternion short term Fourier transform and a quaternion continuous wavelet transform are well defined and obey desirable properties such as conservation laws and reconstruction formulas. The resulting spectrograms and scalograms provide meaningful representations of both the time-frequency and geometrical/polarization content of the signal. Moreover the numerical implementation remains simply based on the use of FFT. A toolbox is available for reproducibility. Synthetic and real-world examples illustrate the relevance and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract= {In 3D single particle imaging with X-ray free-electron lasers, particle orientation is not recorded during measurement but is instead recovered as a necessary step in the reconstruction of a 3D image from the diffraction data. Here we use harmonic analysis on the sphere to cleanly separate the angular and radial degrees of freedom of this problem, providing new opportunities to efficiently use data and computational resources. We develop the Expansion-Maximization-Compression algorithm into a shell-by-shell approach and implement an angular bandwidth limit that can be gradually raised during the reconstruction. We study the minimum number of patterns and minimum rotation sampling required for a desired angular and radial resolution. These extensions provide new av- enues to improve computational efficiency and speed of convergence, which are critically important considering the very large datasets expected from experiment.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of estimating probability density functions on the rotation group $SO(3)$. Two distinct approaches are proposed, one based on characteristic functions and the other on wavelets using the heat kernel. Expressions are derived for their Mean Integrated Squared Errors. The performance of the estimators is studied numerically and compared with the performance of an existing technique using the De La Vallee Poussin kernel estimator. The heat-kernel wavelet approach appears to offer the best convergence, with faster convergence to the optimal bound and guaranteed positivity of the estimated probability density function.},

  title={Low-Resolution reconstruction of intensity functions on the sphere for single-particle diffraction imaging},
  Abstract={Single-particle imaging experiments using X-ray Free-Electron Lasers (XFEL) belong to a new generation of X-ray imaging techniques potentially allowing high resolution images of non- crystallizable molecules to be obtained. One of the challenges of single-particle imaging is the reconstruction of the 3D intensity function from only a few samples collected on a planar detector after the interaction of a free falling molecule and the X-ray beam. In this paper, we take advantage of the symmetries of the intensity function to propose an original low-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on an Expansion Maximization Compression (EMC) approach. We study the problem of adequate sampling of the rotation group via simulation to illustrate the potential of the approach.},

  Abstract={The ability to decipher the three-dimensional structures of biomolecules at high resolution will greatly improve our understanding of the biological machinery. To this aim, X-ray crystallography has been used by scientists for several decades with tremendous results. This imaging method however requires a crystal to be grown, and for most interesting biomolecules (proteins, viruses) this may not be possible. The single-particle experiment was proposed to address these limitations, and the recent advent of ultra-bright X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) opens a new set of opportunities in biomolecular imaging.

In the single-particle experiment, thousands of diffraction patterns are recorded, where each image corresponds to an unknown, random orientation of individual copies of the biomolecule. These noisy, unoriented two-dimensional diffraction patterns need to be then assembled in three-dimensional space to form the three-dimensional intensity function, which characterizes completely the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecule.

This work focuses on geometrical variations of an existing algorithm, the Expansion-Maximization-Compression (EMC) algorithm introduced by Loh and Elser. The algorithm relies upon an expec-tation-maximization method, by maximizing the likelihood of an intensity model with respect to the diffraction patterns. The contributions of this work are (i) the redefinition of the EMC algorithm in a spherical design, motivated by the intrinsic properties of the intensity function, (ii) the utilisation of an orthonormal harmonic basis on the three-dimensional ball which allows a sparse representation of the intensity function, (iii) the scaling of the EMC parameters with the desired resolution, increasing computational speed and (iv) the intensity error is analysed with respect to the EMC parameters.},

  Abstract={Bivariate signals appear in a broad range of applications where the joint analysis of two real-valued signals is required: polarized waveforms in seismology and optics, eastward and northward current velocities in oceanography, pairs of electrode recordings in EEG or MEG or even gravitational waves emitted by coalescing compact binaries. Simple bivariate signals take the form of an ellipse, whose properties (size, shape, orientation) may evolve with time. This geometric feature of bivariate signals has a natural physical interpretation called polarization. This notion is fundamental to the analysis and understanding of bivariate signals. However, existing approaches do not provide straightforward descriptions of bivariate signals or filtering operations in terms of polarization or ellipse properties. To this purpose, this thesis introduces a new and generic approach for the analysis and filtering of bivariate signals. It essentially relies on two key ingredients: (i) the natural embedding of bivariate signals – viewed as complex-valued signals – into the set of quaternions H and (ii) the definition of a dedicated quaternion Fourier transform to enable a meaningful spectral representation of bivariate signals. The proposed approach features the definition of standard signal processing quantities such as spectral densities, linear time-invariant filters or spectrograms that are directly interpretable in terms of polarization attributes. These geometric and physical interpretations are made possible by the use of quaternion algebra. More importantly, the framework does not sacrifice any mathematical guarantee and the newly introduced tools admit computationally fast implementations. By revealing the specificity of bivariate signals, the proposed framework greatly simplifies the design of analysis and filtering operations. Numerical experiment support throughout our theoretical developments. We demonstrate the potential of the approach for the characterization of (polarized) gravitational waves emitted by compact coalescing binaries. A companion Python package called BiSPy implements our findings for the sake of reproducibility.},
